This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `uri` property of the image object before the image has fully been captured and processed. This can happen if you try to use the `uri` immediately after taking the picture, leading to an undefined value or a blank string. This is because the image is asynchronously saved by the camera, and you need to wait for it to complete.
